## About
Greetings! I am master’s student in Aalto University, studying Automation and Electrical Engineering as my major. Besides my studies, I have a part-time job as a software developer in unnamed company in Helsinki. 

As I had computer science as my minor in bachelor’s studies, I have tried to get as many courses as possible of computer science courses also in my master’s studies. I am interested to learn more about web development as it seems to be a growing trend in software developing business. 

Soon I will complete my master’s studies and graduate to Master of Science, but before that happens I want to use my leverage as student to take courses and get knowledge of computer science courses.

# This course 008

I took this course as I was interested in learning basics of DevOps. As this course was only 1 credit, I thought it would be easy to find space and time for completing this course. 

Before this course, I’ve heard the buzzword DevOps many times, but I didn’t really know what to expect from it. When I saw this course I thought, why not to enhance my knowledge about this subject too. In good guided learning environment, it is easier to get familiar with the subject when the course gives goals to achieve.

It was nice that the course had some questionnaires about the subject and project to practice DevOps in real life. Negative part I can think about the course, was that the start of project and opening of the questionnaires were both delayed so I couldn’t start it earlier.

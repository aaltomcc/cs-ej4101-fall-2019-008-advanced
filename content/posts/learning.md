# Learning 008

I learned following thing in the course:

* Basics about DevOps
* GitHub Pages
* Hugo for creating simple pages
* Utilizing Travis CI for deployment

Git was familiar for me before this course, but utilizing GitHubs features was new to me. Before, I have used git only as command line tool for branches, push, commiting, merging etc. But I haven't really thought about other features like GitHub Pages or third-party CI/CD tools like Travis CI. Especially Travis CI was interesting tool to try out. 

I think that I will use my learned things in future in my own projects and try to utilize the knowledge of tools used in course if I encounter other CI/CD tools. To conclude, I am pleased that I'm more familiar with DevOps as subject and with tools to enable continous integration than when I started this course.
